This same substrate(host tree) has produced fresh fruiting bodies each summer(beginning in mid to late August). Came a bit late this year, but fresh wounds and cut locations on the tree took a bit longer for the mycelium to proliferate(from late winter to September). Images of growth added from initial observation on 9/2/19. Harvested/dehydrated a single small slice for home herbarium/voucher. We have eaten fresh, young slices from this location for the last 2 summers and they are mild and DO indeed taste akin to chicken meat. My experience with the similar species Laetiporus conifericola(fruits on conifers and is far more common here in Washington state) has always been disappointing and the flesh of that species tastes like crushed aspirin(very bitter). The hardwood fruiting sulfur shelf in the midwest(Iowa/Missouri) Laetiporus sulphureus and Laetiporus cincinnatus are mild and taste almost as good as our Laetiporus gilbertsonii.

Tree ID: eucalyptus tree
Observations: Fungus was located on bare soil, most likely infected near my tree roots. Closest tree was a eucalyptus tree, located roughly 6 feet away. Tree did not show visible signs of fungus. Only one sporophore was found (on ground). Tree leaves on one side looked more yellow than the other side. No deadwood shown on trunk.

Most of the material was quite hardened and dry, not ripe for harvest, but some was nice and fleshy still. Photo # 3 shows the lower surfaces. Coin used for scale is a US quarter dollar (¢25 piece), 24.26 mm, 0.955 inch in diameter.

Update (evening of the same day): Cooked these bad boys up. Washed well first. Sliced them into thin strips, and pan fried on medium heat in olive oil, with chopped garlic, salt, black pepper, and few squeezes of orange juice. Cooked until well shrunk and starting to crisp. Enjoyed with a Tecate Light with a dash of peach juice. Flavor and texture very much like chicken meat, with just a slight hint of woodiness in a few bites. We shall see later if this, my second, experiment with eating this species goes well or leaves my stomach turned.

Young fruiting on a living weeping Cherry tree.
Almost a month later than prior seasons at this location.
I have monitored/documented annual fruiting of L. gilbertsonii on cherry trees in this same area regularly since 2017.
Harvested a small portion for culinary use. Left the remaining sections to mature.
Dehydrated 2 small sections and bagging for herbarium collection/genetic record.
My coinciding Mushroomobserver observation below-

UPDATE on 10/6/22: specimens are all thinning/planing/lengthening. Caps orange, pore surface vibrant yellow and nearly at maturity. Uploaded all shots from today(10/6/22). Images 12-19. Harvested a small portion for culinary use.

Western Hardwood Sulphur Shelf (Laetiporus gilbertsonii)
Fungi of California https://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Laetiporus_gilbertsonii.html
""Common Name: sulphur shelf, chicken of the woods
Misapplied name: Laetiporus sulphureus
Sporocarp: Fruiting body annual; sessile to substipitate, consisting of overlapping, rounded fleshy shelves, 7-55 cm broad, upper surface smooth to roughened, yellow with reddish-orange to orange bands, margin yellow, irregular; flesh 2-3 cm thick, white to yellow; lower surface finely pored, bright yellow; in age fruiting body becoming dry, white and crumbly.
Habitat: Late summer to early fall on logs and stumps of hardwoods. It is particularly common on species of Eucalyptus.
Edible with caution. Prized by many, this species is also known to occasionally cause gastrointestinal upsets. This appears to be caused by eating old and/or insufficiently cooked specimens. If you decide to try it, eat only the young, fresh, growing margins, in small quantities, and cook it thoroughly.
Comments: The brilliant yellow-orange, fleshy shelves of Laetiporus gilbertsonii are unlikely to be mistaken for any other fungus. The sulphur shelf is unusual in that it fruits well before the start of Bay Area rainy season, often in very dry weather. Nonetheless, fruitings, which can be massive, can literally exude moisture. The brightly-colored shelves persist several weeks, then fade to greyish-white, crumble and fall to the ground. Old fruitings on Eucalyptus are frequently infested with termites. Fruitings repeat year after year from the same stump or log.
Our sulphur shelf has long known locally as Laetiporus sulphureus. But we now know that the true L. sulphureus does not occur in the Western United States and that the sulphur shelf that grows on hardwoods in California needs the new name L. gilbertsonii. The sulphur shelf that grows conifers in California is now called Laetiporus conifericola. In the Sierras it is very common on red fir (Abies magnifica).

Western Hardwood Sulphur Shelf (Laetiporus gilbertsonii)
Fungi of California https://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Laetiporus_gilbertsonii.html
""Common Name: sulphur shelf, chicken of the woods
Misapplied name: Laetiporus sulphureus
Sporocarp: Fruiting body annual; sessile to substipitate, consisting of overlapping, rounded fleshy shelves, 7-55 cm broad, upper surface smooth to roughened, yellow with reddish-orange to orange bands, margin yellow, irregular; flesh 2-3 cm thick, white to yellow; lower surface finely pored, bright yellow; in age fruiting body becoming dry, white and crumbly.
    Habitat: Late summer to early fall on logs and stumps of hardwoods. It is particularly common on species of Eucalyptus.
    Edible with caution. Prized by many, this species is also known to occasionally cause gastrointestinal upsets. This appears to be caused by eating old and/or insufficiently cooked specimens. If you decide to try it, eat only the young, fresh, growing margins, in small quantities, and cook it thoroughly.
    Comments: The brilliant yellow-orange, fleshy shelves of Laetiporus gilbertsonii are unlikely to be mistaken for any other fungus. The sulphur shelf is unusual in that it fruits well before the start of Bay Area rainy season, often in very dry weather. Nonetheless, fruitings, which can be massive, can literally exude moisture. The brightly-colored shelves persist several weeks, then fade to greyish-white, crumble and fall to the ground. Old fruitings on Eucalyptus are frequently infested with termites. Fruitings repeat year after year from the same stump or log.
Our sulphur shelf has long known locally as Laetiporus sulphureus. But we now know that the true L. sulphureus does not occur in the Western United States and that the sulphur shelf that grows on hardwoods in California needs the new name L. gilbertsonii. The sulphur shelf that grows conifers in California is now called Laetiporus conifericola. In the Sierras it is very common on red fir (Abies magnifica).
