""The mushroom can be prepared in most ways that one can prepare chicken meat. It can also be used as a substitute for chicken in a vegetarian diet. Additionally, it can be frozen for long periods of time and retain its edibility. In certain parts of Germany and North America, it is considered a delicacy.

L. sulphureus prepared dish

In some cases eating the mushroom ""causes mild reactions ... for example, ""swollen lips"" or in rare cases ""nausea, vomiting, dizziness and disorientation"" to those who are sensitive.[5] This is believed to be due to a number of factors that include allergies to the mushroom's protein or toxins which are only somewhat stable at high temperatures. As such, many field guides[who?] request that those who eat Laetiporus exercise caution by only eating fresh, young brackets and begin with small quantities to see how well it sits in their stomach.

Laetiporus sulphureus has a potent ability to inhibit staph bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), as well as moderate ability to inhibit the growth of Bacillus subtilis.[6]""

I am under the impression that it is white-pored chicken of the woods but I have never encountered one of these while foraging before. Confirmation or suggestions as to what this may be would be greatly appreciated. 

Large, fruiting body. Right next to a deciduous tree stump, but not growing from it or connected to it in anyway. The outside is pale orange and has a soft, smooth texture. The top of it is paler and feels harder, almost rubbery. The inside flesh is the color of raw salmon and feels incredibly wet. The flesh was very tender to cut into, I didn’t have a foraging knife on me and had to use my keys (it worked well.) The flesh itself was stringy with the flesh deeper inside of the fruiting body being pale, almost white. When squeezed the flesh released a clear liquid. Smells similar to Laetiporus sulphureus, but slightly funkier. This area has been experiencing a 3 week drought. Temperature has been in the 70’s.
